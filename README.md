- Monotonic stack problems
- BFS using Queue
- Implement stack using queue and vice versa
- Next greater element

### Trees

- Binary tree traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder, level order
- Binary Search Tree operations
- Height, diameter of tree
- Lowest Common Ancestor

### Graphs

- BFS and DFS traversal
- Detect cycle in directed and undirected graph
- Topological sort
- Shortest path: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford

### Dynamic Programming

- Memoization vs Tabulation
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
- Coin change problem

### Sorting and Searching

- Binary search and its variations
- Merge sort, Quick sort
- Counting sort

### Resources

- Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet (free, best for beginners)
- LeetCode: Start with Easy, then Medium

## Phase 3 — Spring Boot and Backend

### Pre-Spring Essentials (Web Fundamentals + Maven)

- Client-Server architecture (how a browser/app talks to a server)
- HTTP protocol basics: request-response cycle
- HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and when to use which
- HTTP status codes: 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx (and the commonly used ones: 200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- Request and Response structure: headers, body, query params, path params
- Statelessness of HTTP
- JSON as a data exchange format
- What is an API, and what makes an API "RESTful"
- Basics of Postman (testing APIs before building a frontend)
- Maven: project structure, pom.xml, dependencies, build lifecycle, plugins

### Spring Core (Framework Fundamentals)

- IoC container and Dependency Injection (constructor vs setter vs field injection)
- Bean lifecycle (instantiation, initialization, destruction)
- Bean scopes: Singleton, Prototype, Request, Session
- ApplicationContext vs BeanFactory
- @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Configuration, @Bean
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): cross-cutting concerns, @Aspect, @Before, @After, @Around, @Pointcut expressions, weaving (compile-time vs runtime)

### Spring Boot Essentials

- Auto-configuration (how Spring Boot decides beans automatically)
- application.properties / application.yml and profiles
- Starter dependencies
- Spring Boot Actuator (health checks, metrics)
- Externalized configuration with @Value and @ConfigurationProperties
- Custom auto-configuration and conditional beans (@Conditional, @ConditionalOnProperty)

### Spring MVC Architecture

- DispatcherServlet request flow (front controller pattern)
- @Controller vs @RestController
- @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping
- @PathVariable, @RequestParam, @RequestBody, @ResponseBody

### REST API Development

- DTO pattern (separating entity from API contract)
- Request validation with @Valid and Bean Validation annotations
- Global exception handling with @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler
- Pagination and sorting (Pageable, Sort)
- ResponseEntity and proper HTTP status codes
- API versioning strategies
- HATEOAS basics

### Spring Data JPA and Hibernate

- Entity mapping (@Entity, @Id, @Column, @Table)
